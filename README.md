I am a full-stack software developer who is keen to learn new technologies! In a previous life I read History which provided me with an analytical set of skills, enabling me to efficiently read, decipher, and condense information. Additionally, my sporting, leadership and military training has made me a confident, team player with a high degree of personal perseverance.

## About Me
Born and raised in Hong Kong, I attended Fettes College in Edinburgh on an all-rounder scholarship. I then went on to read History at the University of Exeter where I was awarded a second class, first honours degree. I enjoy travelling and in the last year I have visited Western and Central Europe, Asia, and South America. Most recently, this November I visited the headquarters of the Christina Noble’s Foundation in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Swimming, cycling, and running keeps me active, and I also enjoy skiing, ski-touring, sailing, diving, rock climbing, hiking, and triathlon. Currently, I am training with the aim to complete a Half-Ironman triathlon in Cascais, Portugal in September 2018.
