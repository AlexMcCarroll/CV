I am a full-stack software developer who is keen to learn new stacks! In a previous life I read History which provided me with an analytical set of skills, enabling me to efficiently read, decipher, and condense information. Additionally, my sporting, leadership and military training has made me a confident, team player with a high degree of personal perseverance.
